## usage

Download and run `main.py`.

See a help message with `py main.py -h` or `python3 main.py -h`.

Randomly generating names requires adding to the folder with `main.py` two files named `nouns.txt` and `adjectives.txt`. They are expected to each have one word per line.

If you will use this script often, you may want to [create a custom terminal command](https://wheelercj.github.io/notes/pages/20220320181252.html).
