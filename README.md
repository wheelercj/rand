# rand

A command-line tool for randomly generating passwords, names, and more. The random password generation is cryptographically secure.

Run the script with the `-h` option to see a help message explaining how to use it.

Randomly generating names requires two files in the scripts directory named `nouns.txt` and `adjectives.txt`. They are expected to each have one word per line (and no empty lines).
